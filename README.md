# NeedleWindow

If you suffer from tabitis then suffer no longer. 
Combining Langchain + Huggingface Embeddings + Firefox/Chrome extensions finally gives us relief from the vexing self-inflicted self-doubt. 'What is wrong with us?' we will wonder no longer!

By pressing a shortcut key combination a prompt window appears, and after entering a query, the appropriate tab is moved to top of your cluttered desktop as the active window.

FeelsLikeMagicâ„¢ straight fresh out of the oven.

Works with PDFs. Other convenience features also planned.
