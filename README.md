# NeedleWindow

If you suffer from tabitis then suffer no longer. 
Combining Langchain + Huggingface Embeddings + Firefox/Chrome extensions finally gives us relief from the vexing self-inflicted self-doubt. 'What is wrong with us?' we will wonder no longer!

By pressing a shortcut key combination a prompt window appears, and after entering a query, the appropriate tab is moved to top of your cluttered desktop as the active window.

FeelsLikeMagicâ„¢ straight fresh out of the oven.

Works with PDFs. Other convenience features also planned.

### Step 5: Set executable permissions for the launch script
```bash
cd Ubuntu/flask
chmod +x launch.sh
```

### Step 6: Run the launch script
```bash
./launch.sh
```

### Step 7:
- Choose GPU (y/n) (you have to type this)
- Choose gui vs hotkeys (hotkeys use pynput keylogger)

<div align="leftr">
    <img src="images/GUI.png" alt="Needle Window GUI">
</div>

If using the GUI:
N = 1 will automatically choose the most relevant page. If N > 1 the top N relevant results will be clickable.

If using hotkeys it is always N = 1.
